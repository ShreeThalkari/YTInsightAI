# YouTube Transcript AI Analyzer 🎥🧠

A smart AI-powered tool that extracts transcripts from YouTube videos, summarizes them, provides key insights, and answers user questions — all via a simple command-line interface.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔗 Extracts transcripts from YouTube videos (supports different languages)
- ✂️ Automatically chunks and summarizes long transcripts
- 📌 Extracts bullet-point key insights using a meeting-summary model
- ❓ Answers user questions using a question-answering transformer model
- 🧠 Modular codebase for clean extension and reuse

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Transcript Fetching**  
   Uses `youtube-transcript-api` to get video subtitles based on video ID and language.

2. **Summarization**  
   Uses the `facebook/bart-large-cnn` model to generate concise summaries.

3. **Insight Extraction**  
   Applies `knkarthick/MEETING_SUMMARY` to break down key discussion points.

4. **Question Answering**  
   Leverages `deepset/roberta-base-squad2` to answer user questions based on transcript content.

## 💻 System Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher  
- Internet connection (to download models and fetch transcripts)  
- Recommended: At least 8GB RAM for smooth model inference  
- Optional: GPU acceleration (with PyTorch) for faster processing

## 📦 Installation

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🧪 Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

You will be prompted to enter:

- The YouTube video link  
- The language used in the video (e.g., English, Hindi)

The tool will:
- Fetch and display the transcript  
- Show a summary  
- Print bullet-point insights  
- Allow you to ask questions based on the video

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Can this tool handle videos without subtitles?**  
A: No, it requires subtitles or transcripts available on YouTube.

**Q: Can I use this tool for languages other than English?**  
A: Yes, it supports multiple languages, but summarization and QA models work best on English transcripts.

**Q: Why is the output sometimes incomplete or inaccurate?**  
A: The tool chunks transcripts due to model input limits, which can cause loss of context. Also, model accuracy depends on input quality.

**Q: Can I integrate this tool with a web interface?**  
A: Currently, it’s a CLI tool, but modular code allows easy integration with web frameworks or GUIs.

**Q: How do I contribute or report bugs?**  
A: Please open an issue or submit a pull request on the GitHub repository.

**Q: Why does it fail to extract the transcript sometimes?**  
A: Try copying the link again, check if the YouTube video has a transcript/subtitle (at least autogenerated ones), or try again after some time.

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- Summarization and QA are based on chunking, so context between chunks may be missed.  
- No confidence threshold in QA — the model always returns an answer, even when unsure.  
- Currently a CLI-only tool. No GUI or Streamlit interface.  
- Translation from non-English to English is commented out due to API limits.
